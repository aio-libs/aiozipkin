Support of other collectors
===========================
**aiozipkin** can work with any other zipkin_ compatible service, currently we
tested it with jaeger_ and stackdriver_.

Jaeger support
--------------
jaeger_ supports zipkin_ span format and as a result it is possible to use *aiozipkin*
with jaeger_ server. You just need to specify *jaeger* server address and it
should work out of the box. No need to run a local zipkin server.
For more information see tests and jaeger_ documentation.

Stackdriver support
-------------------
Google stackdriver_ supports zipkin_ span format as a result it is possible to
use *aiozipkin* with this google_ service. In order to make this work you
need to setup zipkin service locally, that will send traces to the cloud. See
google_ cloud documentation how to setup make zipkin collector:
